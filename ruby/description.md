# Ruby

This high-level programming language was developed & designed by [Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto](https://github.com/matz) in 1995.

Fun facts:

- Ruby is implemented in [c](../c/description.md).

- Ruby was created because Matz was looking for a more programmer friendly language, but couldn't find one.

- Ruby is an interpreted scripting language.

# C++

In 1979, this general-purpose programming language was created and designed by [Bjarne Stroustrup](http://www.stroustrup.com/), to be an extension of the [c](../c/description.md) language.

- C++ was called "C, with Classes"

- It's a common misconception, but you do _**not**_ need to learn C before learning C++. However, learning C will help you better understand certain C++ concepts.

- C++ is a very fast language that can be used to produce operating systems, applications, games, and more!

# READ ME

I've gathered a few resources over the past few months, and I thought it be cool to have them all in one place.
I want this to be a tool to help anyone find a little more guidance, no matter what field they're interested in.

Each category will have a markdown file and sub-topics. Every sub-topic will have a breif description, and it's resources will be broken up in three groups:

    - Documentation, articles & e-books

    - Hands on practice

    - Video Walkthroughs/tutorials

Example:

```
    .
    ├── README.md
    └── c++
        ├── description.md
        ├── variables
        └── pointers
            ├── description.md
            ├── docs.md
            ├── practice.md
            └── tutorials.md
    ...
```

If you'd like to add any additional resources or _correct a faux pas_, feel free to fork this repository, commit your changes, then make a pull request!
